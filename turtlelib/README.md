# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- geometry2d - Handles 2D geometry primitives
- se2d - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- frame_main - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input

# Conceptual Questions
1. If you needed to be able to ~normalize~ Vector2D objects (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of a given Vector2D):
   - Propose three different designs for implementing the ~normalize~ functionality
   - Discuss the pros and cons of each proposed method, in light of the C++ Core Guidelines.
   - Which of the methods would you implement and why?

      - Create a free function which takes in a Vector as an object and return another Vector object which is normalised
         - Pros - This is the most sinple way to do it as the function looks self sufficient. It goes in accordance with c++ guideline F.10 due to the reusability. F.3 will also be satisfied as the function is concise
         - Cons - Needs input to be put in by value which can be messed up by the user 
      - Create a member function of the Vector2D (in struct) that changes the value internally of the object called on
         - Pros - Has direct access to the member data points
         - Cons - This can mean that the member itself is changed implicitly which is not what we require. C4 guideline is not met here as it doesnt need direct access to the members
      - Create an operator overload which converts a type Vector 2D to a normalized vector
         - Pros- Ease of use, can be called concisely.
         - Cons - Finding a specific operator to overload which foes with the C.160 guideline of mimic conventional usage will nto work here. The only operator which can closely relate is `^` which is used for bitwise operation but not conventional.

      - I would prefer using implementation 1 due to the independence from any other member and the reusability of the function.

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?
   - Class has default accessiblity as private whereas struct is private.


3. Why is Vector2D a struct and Transform2D a Class (refer to at least 2 specific C++ core guidelines in your answer)?
   -  Use class if the class has an invariant; use struct if the data members can vary independently. Transform2D has logical condition for the members of an object that a constructor must establish but Vector2D dosn't.
   -  (Guideline C8)Use class rather than struct if any member is non-public. Multiple functions in Transform2D class are public.


4. Why are some of the constructors in Transform2D explicit (refer to a specific C++ core guideline in your answer)?
   - It prevents implicit type conversions. According to C++ Core Guidelines, single-argument constructors should be declared explicit to avoid potential bugs.
   

5. Why is Transform2D::inv() declared const while Transform2D::operator*=() is not?
   - Refer to [[https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#con-constants-and-immutability][C++ Core Guidelines (Constants and Immutability)]] in your answer
   - A member function should be marked const unless it changes the objectâ€™s observable state. This gives a more precise statement of design intent, better readability, more errors caught by the compiler, and sometimes more optimization opportunities.
   - Transform2D::inv() does not mutate the observable state of the class so it is made to const as per guidelines.
   - Transform2D::operator*=() changes the state of the class so it con't be made const.
