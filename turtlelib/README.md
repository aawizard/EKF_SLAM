# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- geometry2d - Handles 2D geometry primitives
- se2d - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- frame_main - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input

# Conceptual Questions
1. If you needed to be able to ~normalize~ Vector2D objects (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of a given Vector2D):
   - Propose three different designs for implementing the ~normalize~ functionality

   - Discuss the pros and cons of each proposed method, in light of the C++ Core Guidelines.

   - Which of the methods would you implement and why?

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?
   - Class has default accessiblity as private whereas struct is private.


3. Why is Vector2D a struct and Transform2D a Class (refer to at least 2 specific C++ core guidelines in your answer)?


4. Why are some of the constructors in Transform2D explicit (refer to a specific C++ core guideline in your answer)?
   - It prevents implicit type conversions. According to C++ Core Guidelines, single-argument constructors should be declared explicit to avoid potential bugs.
   

5. Why is Transform2D::inv() declared const while Transform2D::operator*=() is not?
   - Refer to [[https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#con-constants-and-immutability][C++ Core Guidelines (Constants and Immutability)]] in your answer
   - A member function should be marked const unless it changes the objectâ€™s observable state. This gives a more precise statement of design intent, better readability, more errors caught by the compiler, and sometimes more optimization opportunities.
   - Transform2D::inv() does not mutate the observable state of the class so it is made to const as per guidelines.
   - Transform2D::operator*=() changes the state of the class so it con't be made const.
